# stakeholderinterviews

`XLSForm` for OMNeoHealth's stakeholder interviews for use in [Open Data Kit](https://opendatakit.org). This tool is for use by OMNeoHealth data collectors when conducting key informant interviews and focus group discussions on maternal and neonatal health in Papua New Guinea.

## Usage

### 1. Using ODK Aggregator or other similar ODK servers

This `XLSForm` can be uploaded to a remote server-based ODK Aggregator or other ODK servers such as [ONA](https://ona.io), [SurveyCTO](https://www.surveycto.com), [KoBoToolbox](http://www.kobotoolbox.org) and the like. The form is validated and then converted into `XML` format which can then be retrieved from the server into mobile devices as blank forms.

### 2. Convert to XML and transfer to mobile devices via USB cable connection

This `XLSForm` can be converted to `XML` format using [XLSForm Offline from Nafundi](https://nafundi.com/blog/posts/xlsform-offline-and-odk-aggregate-vm-are-now-free/). The `XML` format can then be transferred to the mobile devices (into the device's `odk` folder) via local USB connection.
